# Django-URLs

I created a new GitHub repository with a README.md, and Python .gitignore file, cloned it to my machine/computer, which created a new folder on my computer with my repositoryâ€™s content.

Then, I created a new virtual environment in that folder named env and installed Django in it.

I created a new Django project and used my Zuriboard username (TechieClimi_) as the name of the project and ran all migrations for my project.

 I created a new admin account for my project using the createsuperuser command and started the development server using python manage.py runserver

I opened the URL  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and logged in with my new admin details. Then logged out.

 I opened project_app/urls.py and changed the URL Path for the Django Admin dashboard to zuri-admin/ and I was able to open http://127.0.0.1:8000/zuri-admin/ and login to the admin dashboard.

I staged and committed my Django project and pushed my changes to my GitHub repository, ensuring that I did not add my database (db.sqlite) to version control (GitHub). 

Lastly, I ensured my final code/submission is on the default branch of my GitHub repository.

## P.S : This also, is one of my assignments for the #I4GZuri Scholarship Program
